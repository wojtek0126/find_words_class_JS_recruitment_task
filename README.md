# find_words_class_JS_recruitment_task
Yes, it is THIS task, dev killer task, easy level for junior JS. Basically loop in array then in all arrays below in all directions. Up to down, down to up, left to right, right to left and diagonally. Looks for given word and shows coordinates. Object oriented. It has few flaws now. It was checked by jasmine requirements and I am on my way to fulfill them all. For now, it just works. Needless to say, after long time of doing React this task got me killed. That is why I working am towards fixing this to the end. When will commit comment similar to "completed" appear, it will mean this is ready for use.
