# find_words_class_JS_recruitment_task
JS class based recruitment task with babel

The task was to create JS class that will create object and have method to find a word in that object(expecting it will be array of strings) - of course with advanced coordinates.
As expected, as person doing functional React heavily I have blurred and most likely failed this task. However, made my own breakdown of there project and will most likely complete this task later. Best of luck to any company giving a production tasks of that level and with this time limit threshold to a junior programmer. 

I can't share the whole thing due to copyright. Only .js part that will appear here will be my own creation and therefore will not violate there copyright laws. Project uses babel and jasmine. It has written automation tests to verify results. In these tests there is basically solution included. So once i am finished, there will be searchForWords.js file here that searches the stuff from an array.
